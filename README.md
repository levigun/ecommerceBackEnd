# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This project focuses fully on the back end side of e-commercce. It will be using the latest technologies and able to compete with toher e-commerce companies. We will be working with Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with the MYSQL database.

## User Story
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

```

1. Git clone https://github.com/levigun/ecommerceBackEnd.git . 

2. Open the file in visual studio code.

3. Open the intergrated terminal of the db folder and run "mysql -u root -p".
